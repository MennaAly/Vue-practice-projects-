# How could you benefit from this repository ?
As i believe learning by practicing is the most helpful way i chose to make this repository to help you to get your hand in a Vue projects so you can apply all those concepts you learned.you can pick whatever level you want and you will find a projects in this level and some materials to go through it before you begin implementation and also you will find the implementation video for the project.
My advice to you is to go through the project, read the materials and the prerequisites and begin the implementation if something you couldn't do return back to the video.
and if you want to just go through the videos after studying the materials, from my experience the best way is to watch 10 minutes from the video pause it and go implement and repeat again until the video finishes.
